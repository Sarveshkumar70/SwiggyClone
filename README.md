# 🛵 Swiggy UI Clone (React + Vite)  

## [Checkout LIVE Project](https://swiggylive.netlify.app/)

This is a responsive frontend clone of the Swiggy food delivery website built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It mimics the essential UI and interactions of the Swiggy platform with features like category carousels, restaurant listings, search functionality, and a sign-in modal.

## 🔧 Note
This project uses local JSON data instead of APIs. The goal is to showcase frontend skills without backend dependencies, allowing fast development and easy deployment. This also helps simulate real-world UI behavior and layout structure without worrying about API limits or CORS issues.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Category carousels**: Scrollable sections like "What's on your mind?" and "Top cuisines"
- 🍱 **Restaurant listing**: Grid-based layout with name, rating, food type, and delivery time
- 🔍 **Search functionality**: Live filtering of restaurants by name
- 🔐 **Sign In modal**: Pop-up login UI for user simulation
- 📱 **Fully responsive**: Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
